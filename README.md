## Description

SVGenerator is a Node.js application that takes in an acronym of three characters, text color, shape, and shape color to generate a simple SVG logo.

## Installation

To install, clone the repository to your machine and navigate to the directory in your terminal. Then, run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.

## Usage

To run the application, type `node index.js` into your terminal once you've navigated to the codebase. From there, you'll be prompted for your logo information.

After you've given your logo information to the application, your logo will be saved as `logo.svg` in the same directory as the code.

## Features

Hexadecimal values are variable length. If you wish to define your colors using three-character, six-character, or eight-character (to define transparency) hex values, the application will automatically check for your hex value length and format it properly.
